This project is a simulator for the NHL 2020 Draft Simulator. The program grabs the current standings from the NHL's API, I used the regular rules to run a draft lottery (this part will be outdated/updated as soon as the playoff format is finalized) to produce a draft order, which can be printed at the user's discretion. After importing prospect rankings of the user's choosing, the user can either use a simulated or a user-generated draft based on the user's input of how many rounds should be simulated. The simulated draft automatically picks the highest-ranked available player, while the user draft gives this player as a suggestion before allowing the user to type in their draft choice. Once the draft is completed, the user has the option to print the pick by pick results of the draft and/or the team by team results.
